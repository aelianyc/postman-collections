Hi! Welcome to the Wild Unicorn Tracker. This is a (fictional) app using a RESTful API which would be used to record data of Wild Unicorns when you capture them! The app allows you to add, change/update, view, and delete all Unicorn records in your file. 

A few important notes: 
- There are no actual rules on what data are allowed to be stored, but for the purposes of this project I've set a limited number of fields (Name, Age, Type, Color)
- I created tests that imply that you cannot put non-numerical data in the Age field, and that there are only 3 Colors to choose from. 
- There is a lot of documentation in each Request folder to tell you what test results you are looking for. 
- If you'd like to run these tests for practice, make sure to create a new unicorn and save the ID that is returned in the body of the request results.

## Installation

Sadly, the Wild Unicorn Tracker does not exist for download as an app, but you can access the Postman file of tests if you'd like to practice QA'ing the app!

## Contributing
I'd love to see what tests YOU would add to this file! I'm working on improving my skills as an SDET. Feel free to add and upload your contribution. 

## License
None yet. Unicorns are wild and free. :)
